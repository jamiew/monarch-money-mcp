## Installation

1. Clone or download this MCP server
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/monarch-money-mcp
   uv sync
   ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The server requires the following environment variables for authentication:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MONARCH_EMAIL` | Yes | Your Monarch Money account email |
| `MONARCH_PASSWORD` | Yes | Your Monarch Money account password |
| `MONARCH_MFA_SECRET` | Yes* | Your TOTP secret for 2FA (*required if 2FA is enabled) |
| `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN` | No | Set to `true` to bypass session cache |

### MCP Client Configuration

Add the server to your `.mcp.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monarch-money": {
      "command": "/path/to/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory", 
        "/path/to/monarch-money-mcp",
        "run",
        "python",
        "server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MONARCH_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com",
        "MONARCH_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "MONARCH_MFA_SECRET": "your-mfa-secret-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `/path/to/uv` with the full path to your `uv` executable (find it with `which uv`)
- Replace `/path/to/monarch-money-mcp` with the absolute path to this server directory
- Use absolute paths, not relative paths

### Getting Your MFA Secret

1. Go to Monarch Money settings and enable 2FA
2. When shown the QR code, look for the "Can't scan?" or "Enter manually" option
3. Copy the secret key (it will be a string like `T5SPVJIBRNPNNINFSH5W7RFVF2XYADYX`)
4. Use this as your `MONARCH_MFA_SECRET`

## Available Tools

### `get_accounts`
List all accounts with their balances and details.

### `get_transactions`
Get transactions with smart output formatting and flexible filtering:
- **Smart Output**: Returns compact format by default (reduces data size by ~80%)
  - Compact fields: `id`, `date`, `amount`, `merchant`, `plaidName`, `category`, `account`, `pending`, `needsReview`, `notes`
  - Set `verbose=True` for complete transaction details with all metadata
- **Flexible Date Filtering**: Supports natural language dates
  - Examples: `"last month"`, `"yesterday"`, `"30 days ago"`, `"this year"`
  - Also supports standard formats: `"2024-01-01"`, `"01/15/2024"`
- **Additional Filters**:
  - `account_id`: Filter by specific account
  - `category_id`: Filter by specific category
  - `limit`: Maximum transactions to return (default: 100, max: 1000)
  - `offset`: Pagination offset

### `get_categories`
List all transaction categories.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Account Information
```
Use the get_accounts tool to see all my accounts and their current balances.
```

### Transaction Analysis (Compact Format)
```
Get all transactions from last month - returns compact format with essential fields only.
```

The compact format is perfect for most queries and looks like:
```json
{
  "id": "220177205767991763",
  "date": "2025-08-24",
  "amount": -8.49,
  "merchant": "LA Bagel Delight",
  "plaidName": "LA BAGEL DELIGHT",
  "category": "Restaurants & Bars",
  "account": "Chase Sapphire",
  "pending": false,
  "needsReview": true
}
```

### Transaction Analysis (Verbose Format)
```
Get detailed transaction data with verbose=True to see all metadata, nested objects, and timestamps.
```

### Budget Tracking
```
Show me my current budget status using the get_budgets tool.
```

## Session Management

The server automatically manages authentication sessions:
- Sessions are cached in a `.mm` directory for faster subsequent logins
- The session cache is automatically created and managed
- Use `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in the env section to force a fresh login if needed

## Troubleshooting

### MFA Issues
- Ensure your MFA secret is correct and properly formatted
- Try setting `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in your `.mcp.json` env section
- Check that your system time is accurate (required for TOTP)

### Connection Issues
- Verify your email and password are correct in `.mcp.json`
- Check your internet connection
- Try running the server directly to see detailed error messages:
  ```bash
  uv run server.py
  ```

### Session Problems
- Delete the `.mm` directory to clear cached sessions
- Set `MONARCH_FORCE_LOGIN=true` in your `.mcp.json` env section temporarily

## Development

### Local Development Setup

For local development and testing, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env (git-ignored, never commit this file)
MONARCH_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
MONARCH_PASSWORD="your-password"
MONARCH_MFA_SECRET="YOUR_TOTP_SECRET_KEY"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (no credentials needed)
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run integration tests (requires .env with valid credentials)
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Quick health check script
uv run scripts/health_check.py
```

### Health Check

The health check verifies API connectivity by testing authentication, accounts, transactions, and budgets:

```bash
# As a standalone script (reads .env automatically)
uv run scripts/health_check.py

# As a pytest test
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestHealthCheck -v
```

If the health check fails with a 525 SSL error, it typically means the upstream Monarch Money API has changed and dependencies need updating.

## Notable Differences from Forked Repository

- **Description**: The underlying Python library that provides API access to Monarch Money

This MCP server uses the monarchmoneycommunity fork which tracks the latest Monarch Money API changes.

## Security Notes

> **⚠️ Important**: Monarch Money does not provide an OAuth API or official API access. This MCP server uses unofficial API access that requires your actual account credentials (email, password, and MFA secret). Use with appropriate caution.

### Credential Security
- **Your credentials have full account access** - they can view all financial data and make changes
- Keep credentials secure in your `.mcp.json` file (restrict file permissions)
- The MFA secret (TOTP key) provides ongoing access - treat it like a password
- Session files in `.mm` directory contain authentication tokens - keep them secure
- Never commit `.env` or `.mcp.json` files to version control

### Risk Considerations
- This is an **unofficial API** - Monarch Money could change or restrict access at any time
- Credentials are stored in plain text in configuration files
- Consider using a dedicated Monarch Money account with limited permissions if available
- Review the source code if you have security concerns - it's fully open source
